# Neural Networks: A Continuum of Potential

Theories on neural networks with an infinite number of hidden units were explored since the late 1990's, deepening the understanding of these computational models in two principal aspects: 1. network behavior under some limiting process on its parameters and 2. neural networks from a functional perspective. Continuous neural networks are of particular interest due to their computational feasibility from finite affine parametrizations and strong convergence properties under constraints. In this paper, we survey some of the theoretical groundings of continuous networks, notably their correspondence with Gaussian processes, computation and applications through the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) formulation, and apply the infinite dimensional extension to inputs and outputs all the while considering their universal approximation properties.

# On the Concentration of Measure in Orlicz spaces of exponential type

The study of Orlicz spaces, first described in 1931 by Wladyslaw Orlicz and Zygmunt Wilhelm Birnbaum, became popular in the empirical processes and functional analysis literature, due to the rising interest in chaining arguments to derive probabilistic bounds for stochastic processes, and generalizations of Lp spaces as well as Sobolev space embeddings, respectively. Orlicz spaces exhibit strong concentration phenomena, inherited from their construction. In particular, they are associated to the sub-Exponential and sub-Gaussian classes of random variables. In this article, we aim to provide a brief introduction to concentration of measure in Orlicz spaces, in particular, Orlicz spaces of exponential type. We begin by the construction of these spaces, and delve into certain concentration guarantees and applications.

# On the Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Neural Networks via Gradient Flows

Research in neural network theory is steadily gaining traction, as there is a growing interest in the thorough understanding of the functionalities and the mechanisms through which these models achieve strong performances in decision problems. Several methods have been proposed to quantitatively assess the optimization process of the neural network’s high dimensional non-convex objective, employing various tools such as kernel methods, global optimization, optimal transport, and functional analysis. In this work, we focus on Mei et al.’s analysis of the mean risk field of two-layer neural networks which associates stochastic gradient descent’s (SGD) training dynamics to a partial differential equation (PDE) in the space of probability measures with the topology of weak convergence. Precisely, we dissect the proof of the convergence of SGD’s dynamics to the solution of the PDE, showcase several results regarding the analysis of the latter and their implications on the training process of neural networks via SGD, and discuss related work as well as potential further explorations stemming from various fields.
